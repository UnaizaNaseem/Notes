<h1 align="center">Batch working in Agile</h1>

## What is a Batch?
In agile development work is divided into small batches. In each batch, the goal and the work remain the same. The goal of the batch (also called a sprint) is defined before starting and it does not change over the life of that batch.
At the end of the batch, the team revises what they have done and what new information is now available, and then they define the goal of the new batch in accordance with that. 
The batch size can be defined as the size or quantity of items being worked on and the total amount of work in progress.

## How are Batches useful?
Batches (sprints) help the agile stay focused.
Instead of changing the product with every new information or discovery the team develops what they decided at the start of the batch and the changes are then considered at the end of the cycle. This helps the team stay focused on what was decided, instead of changing their plan with every new development.

Another benefit of batch working is that it makes the whole project much more manageable, as the work is already decided and defined.

Batches help the output to be more steady, as the plan does not need to change once the development has started.
