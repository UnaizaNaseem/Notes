<h1 align="center">Cloud Computing</h1>

## What is Cloud Computing?
- Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.
- Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications.

## What is Virtualization in Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is based on a virtualized IT infrastructure, where servers, os software, networking, etc are abstracted using special software so that it can be divided irrespective of hardware boundaries. a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.
Virtualization allows cloud providers to make maximum use of their data centers.

## What are the Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing?
- On-Demand Self-Service: Cloud services can be used automatically without contacting the service provider. customers can access cloud accounts through the service portal.
- Broad Network Access: Cloud Services can be accessed over all networks using any device even portable devices such as phones, tablets, etc. A public cloud uses the internet and a private cloud uses the local area network.
- Resource Pooling: Multiple customers can share the same physical resources without disturbing privacy and security. This multi-tenant model assigns and reassigns physical and virtual resources based on demand.
- Measured Service: Payment is based on what is the actual consumption such as storage, bandwidth, users, etc.

## What are Cloud Deployment Models?
Service providers usually provide cloud service in the form of three different models to meet different business requirements. These models are as follows:
- SaaS: (Software as a service) also known as cloud-based server or cloud applications is an application software that is hosted on the cloud and users can access via a web browser or application. In most cases, users pay subscription fees which are usually "pay-as-you-go" pricing based on usage. 
- PaaS: (Platform as a service) provides developers with on-demand platforms; hardware, software, infrastructure, and even development tools for running, developing, and managing applications without having to maintain platform-on-premises. With PaaS, the service provider hosts everything, servers, networks, storage, OS, etc. example: Red Hat OpenShift, and Kubernetes.
- IaaS: (Infrastructure as a service) provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources, physical and virtual servers, networks, and storage. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on a needed basis, reducing the need for high-end on-premises infrastructure

## What is Cloud Infrastructure (Regions, Computing Resources, and Storage)?
cloud infrastructure is a term used to define the required components needed for cloud computing which include hardware. abstracted resources, storage, and network resources. Cloud infrastructure is the tools needed to build a cloud.
component of cloud infrastructure:
- Hardware: A cloud network is made up of a variety of physical hardware including networking equipment, like switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, storage arrays, backup devices, and servers. that can be located at multiple geographical locations. 
- Virtualization: Virtualization connects the servers, dividing and abstracting resources to make them accessible to users.
- Storage: Within a single data center, data may be stored across many disks in a single storage array. Storage management ensures data is correctly backed up, that outdated backups are removed regularly, and that data is indexed for retrieval in case any storage component fails.
- Network: The network is composed of physical wires, switches, routers, and other equipment. Virtual networks are created on top of these physical resources.

## Cloud Security and threats.
Cloud Threats:
- Data Breaches.
- Insider Threats.
- Data Deletion.

Cloud Security:
- Firewalls
- Penetration Testing
- VPN's
- Tokenization

## Types of Storage on Cloud.
- Object Storage: Object storage is a data storage architecture for large stores of unstructured data. Objects store data in the format it arrives in. Instead of being organized in files or folder hierarchies, objects are kept in secure buckets that deliver virtually unlimited scalability. It is also less costly to store large data volumes.
- File Storage: File-based storage or file storage is widely used among applications and stores data in a hierarchical folder and file format. 
- Block Storage: A cloud storage service can be used to store data in the form of blocks. Each block has its unique identifier for quick storage and retrieval.

## What are multi-cloud, hybrid multi-cloud, and serverless
- Multi-cloud: "Multi-cloud" refers to the combination and integration of multiple public clouds. A business may use one public cloud as a database, one as PaaS, one for user authentication, and so on.
- Hybrid Multi-cloud: A hybrid cloud combines public cloud computing with a private cloud or on-premise infrastructure.

- Serverless: Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development.

## What are cloud-native applications?
Cloud-native applications are a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. If an app is "cloud native" it is specifically designed to provide consistent development across private, public, and hybrid clouds. Cloud-native development is just thatâ€”an approach to building and updating apps quickly while improving quality and reducing risk.
examples: software containers, microservices, APIs

## What is cloud monitoring?
Cloud monitoring is a method of reviewing, observing, and managing the operational workflow in a cloud-based IT infrastructure. 

Cloud monitoring allows you to find out if your cloud-hosted applications are performing within their Service-Level Agreement (SLA), discover any potential security risks, identify any capacity issues, and analyze costs.

## How does DevOps work on the cloud?
DevOps is mostly based on cloud computing. Cloud computing can increase the efficiency of DevOps teams. For example, the multidisciplinary team can take advantage of virtualization and containerization in the cloud to develop and test applications in identical environments simultaneously and to provision additional resources as needed. DevOps teams can quickly build scalable, highly responsive applications using cloud development tools.
