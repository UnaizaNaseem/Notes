## What is Cloud Computing?
- Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.
- Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications.

## What is Virtualization in Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is based on a virtualized IT infrastructure, where servers, os software, networking, etc are abstracted using special software so that it can be divided irrespective of hardware boundaries. a single hardware server can be divided into multiple virtual servers.
Virtualization allows cloud providers to make maximum use of their data centers.

## What are the Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing?
- On-Demand Self-Service: Cloud services can be used automatically without contacting the service provider. customers can access cloud accounts through the service portal.
- Broad Network Access: Cloud Services can be accessed over all networks using any device even portable devices such as phones, tablets, etc. A public cloud uses the internet and a private cloud uses the local area network.
- Resource Pooling: Multiple customers can share the same physical resources without disturbing privacy and security. This multi-tenant model assigns and reassigns physical and virtual resources based on demand.
- Measured Service: Payment is based on what is the actual consumption such as storage, bandwidth, users, etc.

## What are Cloud Deployment Models?
Service providers usually provide cloud service in the form of three different models to meet different business requirements. These models are as follows:
- SaaS: (Software as a service) also known as cloud-based server or cloud applications is an application software that is hosted on the cloud and users can access via a web browser or application. In most cases, users pay subscription fees which is usually a"pay-as-you-go" pricing based on usage. 
- PaaS: (Platform as a service) provides developers with on-demand platforms; hardware, software, infrastructure, and even development tools for running, developing, and managing applications without having to maintain platform-on-premises. With PaaS, the service provider hosts everything, servers, networks, storage, OS, etc. example: Red Hat OpenShift, and Kubernetes.
- IaaS: (Infrastructure as a service) provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources, physical and virtual servers, networks, and storage. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on a needed basis, reducing the need for high-end on-premises infrastructure
