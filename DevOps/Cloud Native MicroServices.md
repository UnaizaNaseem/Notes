<h1 align="center">Cloud Based Microservices</h1>

 Cloud-native microservices is a software design strategy in which application is diivded into discrete units, called microservices. 
 Each microservice operates independently of the others, but do share data. They can also interact to enable application functionality.

Microservices is an approach to software development where software consists of small independent services that communicate over APIs. Microservices allow a large application to be separated into smaller independent parts, with each part having itsresponsibility. 

Modern cloud-native applications are usually built as microservices 
  
## Pros:
 - Microservices are used to speed up application development.
 - Breaking applications into small, loosely coupled parts makes it easier for developers to build agile and resilient software. 
 - Microservices shorten development cycles.
 - Applications which follow microservices architecture are more flexible because developers can update and test each microservice independently.
 - Microservices applications tend to be more resilient because the failure of a single microservice doesnt mean failure of entire application.
 - Microservices break the code into smaller parts that are easier for developers to work with.
