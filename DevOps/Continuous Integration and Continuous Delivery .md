<h1 align="center">Continuous Integration</h1>

Continuous integration CI is the process of automatically integrating code hanges into a single project. It is a must DevOps practice. Automated tools are used to check the new code before integration.
  
Wthout CI the developers need to collaborate and communicate alot to integrate their code into main. CI  allows  developers to work independently on features in parallel. When they are ready to merge these features into the end product, they can do so independently and rapidly. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build

## How is CI used?

CI is generally used alongside an agile software development workflow. An organization will compile list of tasks that comprise a product roadmap. These tasks are then distributed amongst software engineering team members. Using CI enables these software development tasks to be developed independently and in parallel amongst the assigned developers. Once one of theses tasks is complete, a developer will introduce that new work to the CI system to be integrated with the rest of the project.
  
  
  <h1 align="center">Continuous Delivery</h1>
  
Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.
  
Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.  This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements.
