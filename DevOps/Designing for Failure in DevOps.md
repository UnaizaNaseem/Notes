<h1 align="center">Designing for Failure in DevOps</h1>

## What is Designing for Failure?
Designing for failure is a technique where the developers implement automated processes in the product which are there in case of a system failure. This determines and controls how much of a failure happens, and how it can be controlled easily. This also means that systems fail predictably.


## Why should you ALWAYS design for failure?
Designing for failure when developing any product is a good habit, as this controls the damage to the developed product. If automated processes are built into the system then they log and report any error and in some cases, they may do failure handling. This ensures that the failure is under control and logged so that it can be dealt with.


## How to plan for designing for failure?
Designing for failure can be done by creating a hypothetical situation where a failure was encountered. From the hypothetical situation, some questions are asked and answered. Such as in the case of failure who will be informed, what steps will be taken, which systems were impacted, what was the impact on users, etc? Answering these questions will help the developers build a plan about what to do in case of a system failure.
