<h1 align="center">ELK Stack</h1>
<h2 align="center">What does ELK stand for?</h2>
It is an acronym for three primary components:

- Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine.
- Logstash: Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch.
- Kibana: Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.

<h2 align="center">What purpose does ELK serve?</h2>
The ELK Stack enables centralized log management and real-time log analysis.
Example:

- Logstash can collect log files from each server, parse them, and transform them into a standardized format.
- The transformed log data is then stored in Elasticsearch, which indexes and organizes the data for efficient searching and analysis.
- With Kibana, you can create visualizations, dashboards, and custom queries to explore and analyze the log data.

<h2 align="center">Evolution</h2>
The ELK Stack has evolved over time, and Elasticsearch is now a part of the Elastic Stack, which includes additional components like Beats (lightweight data shippers) and the Elastic APM (Application Performance Monitoring) stack.
