## Definition:
 - Agile software development framework.

## Explanation:
 - Allows mid-sized teams to produce high-quality software with changing requirements.
 - This framework is precise in defining how engineers work.
 - This framework is built on solid values and principles.

## Values and Principles:

 </p>
 
## How it Works?
 - This framework is based on frequent iterations through User Stories.
 - * *User Stories:* * User stories are simple statements of the requirements provided by the user. It is a description of the required system given by the user.
 - Metaphors are created by the team based on the User Stories.
 - * *Metaphors:* * They provide an insight into how the system should work.
 - The team may decide to develop a Spike for some features.
 - * *Spike:* * A Spike can be called a prototype, it is a simple program that is developed to check the sustainability of the proposed features.
## Practices Include in XP:
 - **Continuous Integration:** Code is integrated frequently. 
 - **Test-Driven Development:** Tests are written before code, and code is made to pass those tests.
 - **Pair Programming:** Developers work in pairs.

## When to use XP?
 - When changes are frequent.
 - When requirements are rapidly changing.
 - On small or mid-sized projects.

<h1 align="center">Pair Programming</h1>

## Explanation:
 - Two programmers work together on one computer.
 - One writes the code while the other reviews it.
 - They switch positions frequently.
 - The person writing is called the driver while the other is called the navigator.
 - This technique requires programmers to have the soft skills required for communication between each other as well as the hard skills to write and test code.


## Benefits of pair programming:
 - Reduced mistakes
 - Code is understood and can be managed by more than one developer.
 - Spread of knowledge


## Pair programming styles:
 - Unstructured Style: They work randomly. The collaboration is not distinct or defined by any rules.
 - Driver/Navigator Style: One person handles the coding side while the other handles the strategic side like reviewing. They switch often.
 - Ping Pong Style: One person writes and the other makes the code pass the test. The programmers alternate with each other.
