## What is IT infrastructure?
  IT infrastructure refers to the composite hardware, software, network resources, and services required for the existence, operation, and management of an enterprise IT environment.

## Need for Iac
- In the past, managing IT infrastructure was a hard job. System administrators had to manually manage and configure all of the hardware and software that was needed for the applications to run.
- cost reduction, as you do not need to hire many professionals to manage IT infrastructure.
- Scalability and availability.
- Easier to keep an eye on the whole system
- It solves the problem of inconsistency. If you have several people manually deploying configurations, discrepancies arenâ€™t going to be unavoidable.


## What are configuration files
In computing, configuration files are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs. They are used for user applications, server processes, and operating system settings.
