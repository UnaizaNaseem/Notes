Jenkins is an open-source automation tool for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of software projects. It helps automate various tasks in the software development lifecycle, such as building, testing, and deploying applications.
Jenkins can be integrated with a variety of testing and deployment technologies. 
Continuous Integration with Jenkins triggers a build and test for every change made in the source code.

  - sometimes execute build jobs itself.
- Slave:
