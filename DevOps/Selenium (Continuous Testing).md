<h1 align="center">Continuous Testing with Selenium</h1>

Continuous testing with Selenium is a practice that involves automating tests using the Selenium framework and integrating them into a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. It allows for the frequent and automated execution of tests throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure the quality and stability of web applications.

<h1 align="center">Procedure</h1>

- Test Automation: Selenium provides a suite of tools and libraries for automating web browsers. Using Selenium WebDriver, developers can write scripts in Java, Python, or C# to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and validate expected outcomes.
- Test Framework Setup: A test framework is established to structure and organize Selenium tests. This includes setting up a project, configuring dependencies, and defining test cases and test suites.
- Integration with CI/CD Pipeline: Selenium tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, allowing for their automated execution as part of the software development process. This integration is typically achieved through CI/CD tools such as Jenkins.
- Triggering Test Execution: Selenium tests are triggered automatically based on predefined events within the CI/CD pipeline. This can include triggers such as code commits, scheduled builds, or manual triggers. When a trigger event occurs, the CI/CD tool initiates the execution of the Selenium tests.
- Test Execution: The Selenium tests launch a web browser and perform a series of predefined actions on web pages. These actions can include clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating through pages, and validating the expected outcomes. Selenium WebDriver allows the tests to interact with web elements, capture responses, and make assertions.
- Test Result Analysis: Once the Selenium tests complete execution, the CI/CD pipeline captures the test results, including success/failure status, logs, and any associated artifacts such as screenshots or video recordings. The results are then analyzed to identify any failures or issues in the application.
- Feedback and Reporting: Test results are made available to the development team through the CI/CD pipeline. Notifications and reports are generated to provide feedback on the test outcomes. If a test fails, developers are promptly notified, allowing them to investigate and address any issues.
