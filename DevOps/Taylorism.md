Most of our managerial practices have been coined in the 19th or 20th century by theorists of that time. one such notable theory is that of Taylorism Theory.

This theory was presented by Frederick Winslow Taylor. He and his fellows were the first ever people to study the work process scientifically. They studied and researched how work was performed and factors that contributed to work productivity.

He was the one who presented the idea that managers and workers should cooperate with each other. This was an entirely new concept at that time. He promoted the idea of:

> A fair day's pay for a fair day's work

Taylor worked on improving efficiency in the workplace in multiple ways. he researched and experimented. He presented a few principles which combined called Taylorism. 


## Taylor's Principles:
These principles are as follows:

 - Replace working with "rule of thumb," or simple habit and common sense, and instead use the scientific method to study work and determine the most efficient way to perform specific tasks.
 - Rather than simply assign workers to just any job, match workers to their jobs based on capability and motivation, and train them to work at maximum efficiency.
 - Monitor worker performance, and provide instructions and supervision to ensure that they're using the most efficient ways of working.
 - Allocate the work between managers and workers so that the managers spend their time planning and training, allowing the workers to perform their tasks efficiently.

## Taylorism in Today's World:

 - The principle of co-operation between workers and managers evolved into teamwork, which resulted in higher efficiency.
 - He presented the idea of giving incentives to workers which are in place even today.
 - He broke down workers' work into individual motions nad removed unnecessary motions which if applied even today will produce great results.
 - Surveillance techniques like Taylorism are applied in workspaces even today to supervise if workers are utilizing their time efficiently.
 - Taylor broke down tasks into tiny steps and focused on finding how each worker can provide the best output. This technique is used in the modern world where work systems are examined in order to evaluate the efficiency and maximize productivity.
