<h2 align="center">Why use Infrastructure as Code tools?</h2>

- IaC tools manage infrastructure using configuration files, not GUI.
- IaC ensures safe, consistent, and repeatable infrastructure management.
- Resource configurations can be versioned, reused, and shared.
- Benefits of IaC tools:
   - Automation: Tasks are automated, reducing errors and effort.
   - Consistency: Infrastructure deployments are consistent across environments.
   - Scalability: Easy scaling of infrastructure as needed.
   - Version Control: Configurations stored in version control for collaboration and history.
   - Collaboration: IaC tools promote teamwork in managing infrastructure.
- IaC simplifies infrastructure management, improves efficiency, and ensures reliability.
- Examples: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager.
- IaC uses code-based configurations for versioning, reusability, and sharing.
