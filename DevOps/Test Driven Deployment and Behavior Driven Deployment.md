<h1 align="center">Test Driven Deployment</h1>

## What is Test Driven Deployment?
Test Driven Deployment is a software development technique that focuses on writing and building test cases for the code before developing the actual code.
TDD is an agile development technique. TDD is an effective technique that ensures that the code is thoroughly checked before integration.

### For Example:
When developing a simple program to calculate the age of a person based on their birth year, a TDD approach would first write a test case for the given problem and then write code that passes the developed test case.

## Steps for TDD:
Basic steps are followed for TDD:
 - Write the test case. In the first step test cases are written according to the given problem.
 - Correct the code: If the code does not pass the test case, corrections are made to it.
 - Refactor the code: After the code has passed the test cases, it is refactored to remove redundancy and make it more optimized.

## Why is TDD important for DevOps?
TDD is important for DevOps because if used properly it provides constant feedback to the team. 
TDD also helps write cleaner and optimized code as the code is written to pass the tests.
TDD also makes code integration almost foolproof as the code has already been tested thoroughly. This proves beneficial as code is worked on in batches in Agile. This makes integration easier.

## What is Behavior Driven Deployment?
BDD is a software development technique that is designed to improve communication between engineers and business professionals. In most cases, a software development cycle becomes long and overcomplicated due to next to no communication between engineers and businessmen. This makes the requirements of the software complicated and harder to understand.

This technique focuses on understanding the requirements of a business. This results in a product that is beneficial for the business. In BDD, business value and user requirements are prioritized during development.

<h1 align="center">Difference between TDD and BDD</h1>

 - TDD is a development practice    WHILE   BDD is a team methodology.
 - In TDD developers write tests    WHILE   In BDD tests are written by users (not in a programming language).
 - TDD focuses on the correct implementation of features   WHILE    BDD focuses on software behaviors.
 - In TDD participants are developers    WHILE   In BDD participants are developers and customers.
