## What is ZenHub?

Zenhub is a tool that can be used to organize and document the workflow of projects. 
Zenhub board is connected with a GitHub repo and then you can create, sort, or assign issues in that board.

## Different features in ZenHub:
- After adding a repo you can create "issues".
- issues can be assigned to different "pipelines".
- Users can move issues from one pipeline to another when the status of the issue changes from "need work", to "working on it" to "solved"
- issues can be assigned to one or more than one member.
- There are a few different pipelines already created on the board. You can add pipelines according to your need. Some pipelines with their uses are as follows:
    - <ins>New Issues:</ins> all newly created issues are placed here
    - <ins>Icebox:</ins> Low-priority Issues that do not need to be addressed shortly.
    - <ins>Product Backlog:</ins> Upcoming Issues that have been reviewed, estimated, and prioritized top-to-bottom.
    - <ins>Sprint Backlog:</ins> Issues ready to be worked on in the sprint, prioritized top-to-bottom.
    - <ins>In Progress:</ins> Issues currently being worked by the team.
    - <ins>Review/QA:</ins> Issues open to the team for review and testing. Code complete, pending feedback.
    - <ins>Done:</ins> Issues tested and ready to be deployed to production.
    - <ins>Closed</ins>
- Different templates can be created to define a systematic way to display information. 
- "Labels" are used to categorize issues
- issues can be added to different sprints.
- Epics are a theme of work that contains several sub-tasks or Issues. 
- Epics are the best way to group related issues together into larger goals that span sprints (typically 2-6 weeks).
- Zenhub Issues are a Zenhub entity and do not require a GitHub account to use. Issues are a great option for non-technical team members who don't require access to GitHub and source code, like designers, leadership, and operations team members.
